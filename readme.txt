== Installation ==

1. Upload the `custom-js-css` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Active the Custom JS CSS plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the plugin by going to the `Custom JS and CSS` menu that appears in your admin menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will updating this plugin overwrite my customisations? =
No - the plugin does not provide any custom CSS, JS or PHP. Therefore it will never overwrite your customisations.

= I receive the error: "could not create `custom` folder for JS + CSS" =
You will need to either create the `custom` folder inside the `custom-js-css` plugin folder, or ask your web host to do this for you. This happens on some shared web hosts, due to permissions set by them.
